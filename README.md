Use Apache-tomcat 6.0 host the web service 

In a networked environment, multiple software systems may often need to exchange
information with each other. Web Service stands for an important technology to
facilitate such information exchange especially over the Internet. In general terms, the software system that requests data is called a service requester, whereas the software system that would process the request and provide the data is called a service provider. In this lab project, build a simple service requester and service provider using Web Service and Java.
